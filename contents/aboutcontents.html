<pre class = "pageparagraph">Hello, my name is Chance Watkins and I am an upcoming musician and writer. I am a 
Christian who enjoys spending time with his two kitties Luna and Moonlight as 
well as eating too much chocolate. 
In my spare time I am busy coding, playing music, or playing video games. I sometimes 
play video games (including  Overwatch) competitively so please check out my Twitch 
and Youtube pages and follow my progress. </pre>
